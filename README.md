# DVS-RGB
For numerical methods me and a colleague had to choose an application and model it as a problem discussed at the course (linear systems, eigenvalues, singular values, etc.). We chose to use SVD (single value decomposition) for color image compression. We developed this application for the need to reduce the memory occupied by pictures. We built the application to work on a multitude of file name extensions. It uses SVD (single value decomposition) to reconstruct the image.
“1.png”, “2.jpg”, “3.jfif”, “4.png” are 4 different photos to test.
“Presentation.pdf” is the presentation in Romanian detailing the application.
“main.ipynb” is the source code.
